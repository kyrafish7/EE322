## Pystache
### The second task of this lab was to use the script called Pystache which was installed earlier in this lab to better understand its function
### By executing the `say_hello.py` script 
#### Pystache allows for the substitution of variables within the template with data from a list, resulting in personalized output strings beginning with "Hey."
